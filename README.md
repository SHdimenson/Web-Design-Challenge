# Web-Design-Challenge

Created this website using visualizations we've created in a past assignment (WeatherPy in the Python-API-Challenge). 


This folder contains:

* A `resources` folder that contains the `cities.csv` file.

* An `images` folder that contains a background image and the four visualizations from the analysis.

* A Jupyter notebook `data.ipynb` that was used to read the CSV file into a dataframe and convert that to a HTML table.

* A `styles.css` file that contains additional styling to the website.

* 7 HTML files constitutes 4 visualizations, 1 comparision, 1 data and 1 landing HTML pages.
